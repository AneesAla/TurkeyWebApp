          <h1>Immediate Aftermath of the 2023 Turkey Earthquake</h1>
          <p>
            The 2023 earthquake in Turkey was a seismic event of unprecedented
            scale, impacting millions and exposing the critical need for urban
            planning and disaster readiness. The quake not only shattered lives
            but also infrastructure, leaving a lasting imprint on the region's
            landscape and its people's hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial hours following the earthquake were marked by chaos and
            confusion as emergency services scrambled to respond amidst the
            widespread devastation. With many areas rendered inaccessible due to
            debris and damaged infrastructure, the race against time to rescue
            trapped survivors was fraught with difficulties. The community's
            resilience was tested as thousands of volunteers joined professional
            rescue teams, braving aftershocks and harsh conditions to search for
            signs of life beneath the rubble. This collective effort underscored
            the spirit of unity and the critical importance of timely and
            coordinated disaster response strategies.

            Burak: His home collapsed and buried him and his family under the
            debris, leaving them to the streets in bitter cold temperatures. He
            lost ten people in his family including a two-month-old baby. They
            were unable to escape after being buried shortly after the
            earthquake began. Burak spent more than an hour digging his way out
            until he could finally help his other family members out of the
            wreckage. Burak continued to help search for others and witnessed
            many who lost their lives. He was able to send his sister to other
            family relatives; however, his parents struggled to leave their
            beloved city of Adiyaman. He hopes to return to his job as a mariner
            to gather enough funds to rent, or perhaps one day even buy a new
            home.

            family has taken shelter in a center in Sanliurfa with access to
            food, water, heating, and other supplies. The earthquake instilled
            fear and trauma across thousands, making people weary of entering
            any concrete buildings. Irmine and her family felt safe at this
            center because of its internal steel structure. She occupies this
            space with thousands of others to avoid the cold conditions outside.
            They feel lucky for the basic necessities they currently have as
            many citizens are in far worse conditions. Irmine does not know how
            long they will stay here, but she knows it cannot last forever. This
            is currently their best option.

      <h2 style="font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold">President's Promise</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 25px">
        Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the current president of Turkey since 2014,
        promised to “rebuild these buildings within one year and will hand them
        back to citizens.” He vowed to construct 650,000 new homes with 319,000
        homes built within the first year and another 331,000 in the year after.
        Building efforts are slow, and this promise remains unfulfilled a year
        after the earthquake took place. Erdoğan’s promises are difficult to see
        as attainable by many amidst Turkey’s complicated economic challenges
        such as increasing inflation and cost of materials needed for
        infrastructure.
